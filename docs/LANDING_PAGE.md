# MeMesh — Searchable Project Memory for Claude Code

> Remember decisions, patterns, and context — across every session.

---

## The Problem

Claude Code's built-in memory (CLAUDE.md, auto memory) works for preferences and instructions. But when your project grows, you need answers to questions like:

- "What did we decide about auth last Tuesday?"
- "Why did we switch from REST to GraphQL?"
- "What was the fix for that database timeout?"

CLAUDE.md can't answer these — it's a manual file, not a searchable database.

## How MeMesh Helps

MeMesh gives Claude a persistent, searchable memory that works automatically.

**Monday**: You debug an API rate limit issue
→ MeMesh stores: "GitHub API: 5000 requests/hour, reset at :00"

**Friday**: You ask Claude to add GitHub integration
→ Claude recalls: "I see we're rate-limited to 5000/hour..."

No re-explaining. No wasted time. Just continuity.

## FAQ

**Q: Is my data sent to any server?**
A: No. All memories are stored locally in `~/.memesh/` on your machine.

**Q: Does it work with other AI assistants?**
A: Currently optimized for Claude Code. Cursor support via MCP coming soon.

**Q: How much disk space does it use?**
A: ~100MB for embeddings + ~1MB per 100 memories. Average user: 150-300MB total.

**Q: Can I export my memories?**
A: Yes. `memesh export --format json` exports all memories with timestamps and metadata.

**Q: Does it slow down Claude?**
A: No. Memory operations run in background with sub-50ms query latency.
